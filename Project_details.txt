Based on the provided documents, here is a structured overview of the PulseStream project, showcasing its design, technical depth, and strategic goals.

### Project Name
* PulseStream: An Enterprise-Grade Event-Driven Analytics Platform

### Core Objective & Identity
PulseStream is a real-time, multi-tenant analytics and alerting system designed to ingest and process streaming data. Unlike the built-in dashboards provided by individual API vendors (e.g., Stripe or Twilio), PulseStream is a unified, programmable, and extensible system that aggregates metrics from multiple APIs into a single platform. It aims to provide a "control tower" for companies that rely on external APIs, giving them internal data sovereignty and eliminating vendor lock-in. The project's architecture and features are specifically designed to demonstrate "backend supremacy" and "true production acumen".

### Key Features and Functionality
PulseStreamâ€™s functionality is divided into several core components that form a complete data pipeline:

* **Multi-Tenant Ingestion API:** Clients (tenants) send JSON events to FastAPI endpoints. Each request is validated using Pydantic, secured with OAuth2/JWT, and subject to rate-limiting and role-based access control (RBAC) via Redis.
* **High-Throughput Event Bus:** Validated events are queued into Celery, using Redis as the broker. The system is designed with idempotency and retry policies to handle high-volume streaming loads.
* **Stream Processing & Enrichment:** Workers in a cluster validate and transform events. They can enrich data by making external calls (e.g., GeoIP for location or OpenAI for anomaly tagging).
* **Time-Series Storage:** Processed data is stored in PostgreSQL with the TimescaleDB extension. The database uses partitioning and indexing strategies to optimize real-time read and write operations.
* **Real-Time Dashboard:** A dashboard provides live updates to users via FastAPI WebSockets, showing metrics like rolling charts and status indicators.
* **Historical Reporting:** On-demand background jobs (using Celery) generate reports in formats like CSV or Parquet. These files are stored in S3 and can be securely downloaded via signed URLs.
* **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** The system uses vector embeddings (FAISS) and the OpenAI API to flag unusual patterns in the data. It can also provide AI-generated explanations for "why" an alert was triggered.
* **Alerting & Notifications:** Users can configure specific thresholds per metric and per tenant. When a threshold is breached, Celery tasks dispatch notifications via email, SMS, or other third-party services.
* **Observability & Operations:** The platform is designed with structured JSON logging and integrates with the ELK stack. Health checks and metrics are collected using Prometheus and visualized with Grafana.

### Technical Stack
PulseStream is built on a modern, robust, and industry-standard tech stack:
* **Backend Core:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB.
* **Async & Queueing:** Celery and Redis.
* **AI & Search:** OpenAI API and FAISS.
* **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
* **Testing:** Pytest (for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests) and Locust (for load tests).
* **Hosting:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3) for production environments.

### Project Phases
The project is structured into three phases to progressively build complexity and demonstrate a mature engineering process:
1.  **Phase 1 (Foundational MVP):** Focuses on core ingestion, multi-tenant support, a basic metrics pipeline, real-time dashboards, and simple rule-based alerts.
2.  **Phase 2 (Industrial Expansion):** Adds advanced alerting with dynamic thresholds, data enrichment (e.g., Geo-IP), data retention rules, and a dedicated metrics API. It also begins to incorporate AI enhancements for insights.
3.  **Phase 3 (Enterprise-Grade Platform):** Pushes the project to a product-level platform by implementing advanced features like ML-driven anomaly detection, an event replay system, self-healing pipelines, and enterprise features like SSO and per-tenant billing metrics.

### Why PulseStream is Unique & Industrial Grade
PulseStream is strategically positioned to be a "portfolio killer" by showcasing a developer's mastery of key enterprise-level concepts:
* **Multi-Tenancy by Design:** It demonstrates the ability to build a secure platform that isolates data and configurations for many clients, which is a common requirement in SaaS and enterprise software.
* **Event-Driven at Scale:** It moves beyond simple REST APIs to handle streaming loads, back-pressure, and retries, which are crucial in high-throughput systems.
* **Advanced AI Integration:** The use of vector search (FAISS) and prompt engineering with OpenAI proves the developer is an "AI-native engineer," not just a backend developer.
* **End-to-End Ownership:** The project's scope, from design documents and architecture to CI/CD and monitoring, proves a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development lifecycle.
